# Contributor Notes

This project was originally a fork of the [Spotify Web API Node](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node), which by the time I used it, was not being updated. Due to the need of the use of the "createPlaylist" method, and because it was sending the request with a different path than the one Spotify was receiving, I created this project using all the structure of the original project, but changing the request path to a correct one.

# Project owners are [thelinmichael](https://github.com/thelinmichael) and [JMPerez](https://github.com/JMPerez), with help from [a lot of awesome contributors](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node/network/members).

If you are the owner of the project and wants me to delete this repository, just send me a message.
